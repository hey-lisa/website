We've been building in the AI/web3 space. Things will surface soon.

Consult [Docs](/docs/introduction/lisa) and [Changelog](/docs/project-updates/changelog/lisa) for more details on what the h is going on.

Regarding the $LISA token: we're still finalizing the details. Dates and tokenomics will be announced when we're ready. We're actively exploring various fair launch approaches that prioritize equal access: no insider allocations, no presale, no private rounds. More information coming soon.  

More soon.
