title: Swap
description: Exchange tokens on the same blockchain through integrated DEX protocols. Same-chain asset swapping.
---

### Objective
- Exchange one token for another on the same chain

### Example
- swap 1 ETH to USDC on Arbitrum
- swap 50% of WETH to DAI on Base

### What LiSA extracts
- Token in, token out, chain, and amount
- Optional slippage if you specify it in the chat

### Quote
- Route, fees, and minimum received are displayed before your signature

### Approvals
- First use of a token may require an approval to a spender
- Approvals are revocable at any time
- Approvals are always between you and standard contracts like 1inch, LiFi, etc.
- LiSA never intervenes in this process

### Sign and verify
- Your wallet opens with the swap transaction
- After signing, you see the status in the queue and an explorer link
