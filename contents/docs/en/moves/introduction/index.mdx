description: Introduction to LiSA moves. Transform chat instructions into direct on-chain actions across supported networks.
---

### Chat interface
- Say what you want in the chat
- LiSA reads the intent, tokens, chains, amounts, etc. and discusses with you if information is missing.
- LiSA transforms the intention into one or more transactions.

### Complex requests
- A request can chain multiple actions, for example swap then bridge
- You can use % or parts for amounts ("send half of my USDC to Arbitrum, and the other half to Avalanche")
- You can distribute across multiple chains or recipients in a single sentence

### Quotes and signatures
- Each transaction includes: route, fees, minimum received, time estimate, etc.
- Nothing executes until you have signed the transaction
- If an approval is needed, you sign it first, then you sign the action
