title: Revoke
description: Remove token approvals and spending permissions. Revoke contract access to your assets for security.
---

### Objective
- Remove existing approvals to reduce risk.
- Use for cleanup after testing apps or to harden a wallet.

### Examples
- revoke all approvals on Arbitrum
- show approvals on Ethereum

### Scan and overview
- LiSA scans supported chains to find approvals on your linked addresses.
- LiSA displays a reviewable list and allows you to filter by chain, asset, or spender.

### Prepare and queue
- LiSA prepares revoke transactions and places them in the queue.

### Security
- Revoking does not move funds.
- If an approval is needed later, LiSA will request it at that time.

### Sign and verify
- Your wallet opens with the revoke transaction.
- After signing, you see the status in the queue and an explorer link.
