title: Transaction queue (TX Queue)
description: Transaction queue management for moves. Review and sign on-chain transactions before execution.
---

Each request in LiSA is translated into concrete moves, swap, bridge, send, revoke, which resolve into exact on-chain transactions necessary to execute it.
These transactions must be chained in a deliberate order.
The transaction queue is where they align for your review and signature, transforming intention into execution, one confirmed step at a time.

### What it is
- An ordered and visible list of unsigned transactions prepared from your request
- An intention can produce a single transaction or a chain of dependent transactions.

### How it works
- LiSA sequences all required steps and places them in the queue
- You review and sign each item in order, nothing executes without signature

### Signatures and custody
- All transactions remain unsigned until your wallet prompts you to sign
- All signatures are client side in your wallet and are never accessible to LiSA
- No signature, no submission. No funds move without your approval
- Funds NEVER transit through LiSA: you interact directly with pools, aggregator contracts, etc.

### After submission
- The next item becomes ready only after the on-chain confirmation of the previous one
- You get explorer links and statuses for each submitted transaction
- You can interrupt a chain of transactions in the middle of execution without problem, funds are ALWAYS on one of your wallets, but possibly in an intermediate form.
- If you stop signing, nothing else executes
