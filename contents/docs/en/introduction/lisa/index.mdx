### Definition
- LiSA is an AI for the Web3.
- You describe what you want in the chat, it transforms your words into on-chain actions.
- You describe, backtest, and execute any trading strategy (from simple DCA to complex technical analysis).

### Non-custodial
- 100% of our solutions are non-custodial.
- This means that neither LiSA, nor its human colleagues, can transfer your funds on your behalf.
- For vault strategies: LiSA can trade on your funds but cannot withdraw.
- For Hyperliquid: LiSA uses your API without withdrawal permissions.

### Why it exists
- Allow you to express and backtest strategies using technical indicators (RSI, EMA, ATR, etc.) before executing live.
- Execute strategies on-chain via our vault or on Hyperliquid via API.
- Reduce friction for everyday on-chain actions.
- Preserve your sovereignty, with your keys, your signatures, and transparent steps verifiable on-chain.
