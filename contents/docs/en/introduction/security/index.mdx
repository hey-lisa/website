### Security
- 100% of our solutions are non-custodial
- This means that LiSA never holds funds and never moves tokens alone.

### Security associated with "moves"
- Each action is a transaction prepared by LiSA that YOU sign.
- These are standard (and verifiable) transactions interacting with known and recognized contracts from aggregators and liquidity pools like LiFi, 1inch, Aave..
- You are always the signer and your keys never leave your wallet.

### Security associated with strategies:
- Our trading engine is connected to your funds but neither LiSA nor the team ever has any means to withdraw.
- On Hyperliquid: the API key rights do not include withdrawal.
- On-chain: your funds are on a contract (vault). Neither LiSA nor the team owns the rights to execute the withdraw() function on vaults, LiSA can only swap on your behalf on pre-whitelisted pools (Uniswap etc.)
