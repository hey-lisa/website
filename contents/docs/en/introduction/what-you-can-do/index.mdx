### Ask in chat
- All interactions with our tools are done in natural language.
- Ask LiSA what you want: LiSA transforms it into one or more transactions that you review and sign.
- Discuss your investment or trading strategy with LiSA
- LiSA executes your requests

LiSA's capabilities are grouped into 2 themes: moves and strategies.

### Moves
- Moves are everything that is on-chain movements: swap, bridge, transfers, etc.
- Swap: exchange one token for another on the same chain.
- Bridge: move assets between chains.
- Send: transfer tokens to another address on a chosen chain.
- Several other moves: Refuel (get native gas), revoke (cancel token approvals)
- Moves can be combined in 1 single request.

### Strategies
- By strategies we mean: trading plans, any kind of DCA (from the simplest to the most complex), all rebalancing plans, etc.
- You provide strategies in the chat.
- LiSA (among others) transforms this strategy into a plan executable by our trading engine.
- Strategies can be executed on-chain (via our vault), or on hyperliquid (via API).
- You keep 100% full custody of your funds.
- Backtesting allows you to simulate any strategy on historical data, before launching live.
- Strategies can be private or public.


### Examples
- Basic move:
Bridge 100 USDC from Ethereum to Arbitrum
- Complex move:
Sell 1 ETH for USDC, send 50% to Arbitrum, and the other half to 0x1234... on Avalanche
- Basic strategy:
I want to buy $30 of bitcoin every day at the same time
- Enhanced DCA strategy:
Buy $50 of BTC every day, double to $100 when the price drops more than 10% in 24h
- Advanced DCA strategy:
Buy 30 USDC of BTC every day at 09:00, double to 60 USDC if price fell more than 10% in the last 24 hours, cap weekly budget at 250 USDC, do nothing if RSI 14 is above 70
- Advanced trading strategy:
On all pairs, take a long position when EMA 50 is > EMA 200 and RSI 14 crosses 40 upward, stop loss at 1.5 times ATR 14 (risk = 2% / trade), take profit at 2 risk reward, maximum 1 entry. Take a short position on the opposite.
