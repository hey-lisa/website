description: Utility token that powers LiSA access, strategy execution, and platform features. 
---

$LISA is the utility token that enables access to LiSA and its ecosystem of features.

### Core Concept
- **Hold-to-access model**: You must hold $LISA tokens to use LiSA
- **Utility token**: Powers access, strategy creation and participation, and fee mechanisms
- **ERC-20 standard**: Built on Ethereum for broad compatibility

### Why it exists
$LISA ensures committed participation in the LiSA ecosystem while providing a consistent unit for fees, rewards, and economic incentives within shared strategies.
