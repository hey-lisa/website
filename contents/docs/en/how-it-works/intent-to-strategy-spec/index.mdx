### Flow
- You and LiSA refine the strategy in chat, logic, markets, cadence, sizing, risk indicators, tools and indicators used..
- A specialized strategy agent, powered by the trading engine grammar, and available tools, compiles the final description provided by LiSA into machine language.
- The strategy encodes an execution graph and expressions, State management, etc. that allows executing complex strategies
- The trading engine can execute these strategies deterministically, without possible ambiguity.
- Once validated, the strategy can be shared, modified, refined, and executed from your strategy hub.
- Any strategy can be automatically backtested on historical data
