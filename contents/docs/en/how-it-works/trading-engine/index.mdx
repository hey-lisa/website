### Model
- Deterministic evaluation on a fixed tick, hourly by default.
- Reads market candles from internal oracle
- Emits actions to the chosen adapter and records fills, positions, and PnL.

### Execution channel
- For Hyperliquid: LiSA places and monitors orders via your account's API.
- For vault strategies: funds are in the vault, on which LiSA has trading capabilities
- LiSA can swap assets by interacting with whitelisted pools and tokens

### Security
- In both cases: LiSA is unable to withdraw your funds
