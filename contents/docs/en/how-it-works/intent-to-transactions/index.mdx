### Flow
- You ask LiSA to perform an onchain move
- LiSA discusses with you to get all necessary info (if needed)
- After various verifications (address format, recipient policy, linked addresses, basic token checks, balance, etc.)
- LiSA prepares transactions with aggregators and bridges
- Transactions are returned to you in deliberate order, unsigned
- You examine the txs, and sign them in sequence
- After each signature, once a transaction is confirmed, the next one becomes ready to be signed
