description: Monitor and manage token allowances across contracts. View active approvals and revoke spending permissions.

### What are approvals?

To interact with aggregators and liquidity pools, you must authorize contracts to spend your tokens. These allowances are necessary for:
- Bridge funds between chains via LiFi contracts
- Swap on DEXs via 1inch, Uniswap, etc.
- Any interaction with DeFi protocols

### Approval security

Allowances should not remain open indefinitely for security reasons:
- They give permanent access to your tokens
- A compromised contract could use your old approvals
- Regularly cleaning up reduces your attack surface

### View your approvals

- See the spender, token, chain, and approved amount
- Check the age and last use of each approval
- Filter by chain or protocol for a targeted overview

### Revoke approvals

**From the interface**:
- Revoke directly from the active approvals list
- Select one or multiple approvals to remove

**Via chat**:
- Ask LiSA to list your active approvals
- Ask LiSA to execute the Revoke move to remove them
- Exact amount approvals are supported when possible

### Recommended management

- Revoke approvals after use on unknown protocols
- Keep active only approvals from protocols you use regularly
- Periodically check your approvals to maintain good security hygiene
