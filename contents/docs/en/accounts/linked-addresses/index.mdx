### How to link in chat
- Ask LiSA.
- LiSA displays a one-time link code, to copy
- On the other wallet, connect and ask LiSA
- Sign a one-time proof in each wallet to confirm control.
- Once linked, both addresses appear under the same profile.

### Manage
- Ask LiSA: list linked addresses
- Ask LiSA: unlink 0xABCDâ€¦ to remove one
- Add labels and short notes for context.
- Or in options

### Security
- Linking gives no spending permissions.
- Each action always requires a signature from the address that holds the funds.
