### What it is
- **Standard ERC-20 on Ethereum**: Built on the most widely adopted token standard
- Powers all LiSA access and strategy mechanics
- You must hold $LISA to use any LiSA features
- Provides access to LiSA features and associated services

### Core Functions

**Access Control**
- A minimum balance of $LISA is required for all LiSA features
- Your effective hold = $LISA in wallet + $LISA locked under your address
- All locks (created strategies + participations) count toward your access threshold

**Strategy Mechanics** 
- Lock $LISA to register and publish strategies with LiSA
- Lock $LISA to participate in shared strategies created by others
- Locks guarantee commitment from both creators and participants

**Fee and Reward System**
- All fees are denominated in $LISA only
- Entry and exit fees can be fixed amounts or percentages of your lock
- Early unlock penalties may apply based on strategy rules
- Fee policies are defined by creators and stored in the strategy specification

### Current Status
- **ERC-20 on Ethereum** with fair launch planned (date to be announced)
- As long as LiSA access remains private, the app can function without tokens
- **No pre-sale or funding**: If launched, liquidity will be 100% bootstrapped
- Final token launch depends on LiSA's transition to public access
