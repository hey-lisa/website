Creators can monetize access to their public strategies in the form of a percentage of $LISA locked by participants.

### How splits work

Splits allow to:
- Automatically compensate strategy creators
- Distribute revenue in $LISA transparently
- Encourage sharing of performing strategies

### Split application

Splits apply to the following events:
- **Entry**: When participants lock $LISA in your strategy
- **Exit**: When participants exit the strat and unlock their $LISA
- **Early unlock**: When participants exit before the planned period

### Configuration

You can fully define the values during the strategy creation process:
- Percentage on entries
- Percentage on exits
- Early unlock penalty (if applicable)
- Specific distribution conditions

### Transparency

All splits and their conditions are:
- Publicly visible in the strategy spec
- Automatically applied by smart contracts
- Verifiable by all participants
