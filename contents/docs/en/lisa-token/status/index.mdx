### Development Phase
- **Private access**: As long as LiSA access remains private, the app can function without any token
- The existence of $LISA depends on LiSA's transition to public access
- All token mechanics are designed and ready for implementation when needed

### Contract Details
- Standard ERC-20 on Ethereum
- Not yet deployed, awaiting launch decision
- **Contract address**: To be announced upon deployment

### Launch Plans
- Fair launch with no pre-sale or private funding
- 100% bootstrapped liquidity if token launches
- Date to be announced pending public access transition
