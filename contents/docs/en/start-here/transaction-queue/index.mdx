title: Transaction Queue (TX Queue)
description: Transaction queue for reviewing and signing prepared transactions. Transaction management.
---

The TX queue is an important part of the UI: it lists prepared and unsigned transactions created from your request.
You review and sign them one by one, nothing executes without your signature.
Each step only unlocks after the on-chain confirmation of the previous step.

See Transaction queue in Moves for more details.
