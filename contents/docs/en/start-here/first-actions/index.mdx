### Your First "Move": from intention to transaction
- Say what you want in the chat
- For example: swap 1 ETH to USDC on Arbitrum.
- LiSA analyzes your request, prepares and sends you one or more transactions to sign.
- You review the details: route used, fees, minimum received, etc.
- You sign the transaction(s).

### Trading strategies, from idea to live
- Describe the plan in the chat.
- For example: I want to buy $30 of bitcoin every single day!
- For example2: Buy 30 USDC of BTC every day at 09:00, double to 60 USDC if price fell more than 10% in the last 24 hours, cap weekly budget at 250 USDC, do nothing if RSI 14 is above 70
- For example3: On all pairs, take a long position when EMA 50 is > EMA 200 and RSI 14 crosses 40 upward, stop loss at 1.5 times ATR 14 (risk = 2% / trade), take profit at 2 risk reward, maximum 1 entry. Take a short position on the opposite.
- LiSA then takes care of compiling your strategy into machine language, directly executable by our trading engine.

- You then access backtest results (strategy execution on historical data) and execution options for live trading.
- Finally you can launch your strategy (on-chain, or via Hyperliquid API)
- Daily: you track your portfolio, your trades, etc. and you can pause or edit your strategy.
- LiSA can programmatically send you daily reports etc.

### Options / Settings
- Profile options: to link multiple of your addresses under the same account
- API key
- Memory options
- etc.
