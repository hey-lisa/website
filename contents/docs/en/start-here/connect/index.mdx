### Steps
- Click Connect, choose your wallet.
- Sign the one-time authentication message in your wallet to start the session.
- Auth is off-chain and costs no gas.

### What the signature does
- Proves that you control the address for this session.
- Creates a session that ends when you disconnect or clear the site data.
- This does not give token approvals and does not move funds.
- LiSA can absolutely never touch your funds
