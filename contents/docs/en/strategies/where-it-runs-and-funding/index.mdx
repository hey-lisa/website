### Hyperliquid
- Uses your account via API.
- LiSA places orders. Keys remain with you.

### On chain
- Uses our on-chain vaults.
- Your funds are in a contract on which LiSA can act in a limited and controlled way.
- LiSA (which owns a wallet) places swaps, but cannot withdraw()
- The vault is coded so that even if LiSA's wallet were under control of a malicious actor, your funds would remain secure.
- The only way for a malicious actor to access your funds is if your own wallet were compromised.
