### Describe in chat
- To create a strategy: ask LiSA!
- LiSA will discuss with you until it has sufficient information.
- When creating strategies, you have access to a list of tools (like a list of technical indicators)

### Compile
- LiSA takes care of the rest: the strategy is then compiled into machine language executable by our trading engine.
- This executable strategy is then visible in your "strategy hub", where you can launch its execution.
