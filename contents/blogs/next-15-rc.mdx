#### Try the Next.js 15 RC today:

```bash
npm install next@rc react@rc react-dom@rc
```

## React Compiler (Experimental)

The React Compiler is a new experimental compiler created by the React team at Meta. The compiler understands your code at a deep level through its understanding of plain JavaScript semantics and the Rules of React, which allows it to add automatic optimizations to your code. The compiler reduces the amount of manual memoization developers have to do through APIs such as useMemo and useCallback - making code simpler, easier to maintain, and less error prone.

```tsx
import "@/styles/globals.css";
import { Inter as FontSans } from "next/font/google";

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

const fontSans = FontSans({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-sans",
});

export default function RootLayout({ children }: RootLayoutProps) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head />
      <body
        className={cn(
          "min-h-screen bg-background font-sans antialiased",
          fontSans.variable
        )}
      >
        ...
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
