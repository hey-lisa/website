## Automatic Installation

We recommend starting a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```bash showLineNumbers  {2}
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After the prompts, **create-next-app** will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Manual Installation

To manually create a new Next.js app, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

Open your **package.json file** and add the following **scripts**:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

## Creating directories

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.

The app directory
For new applications, we recommend using the App Router. This router allows you to use React's latest features and is an evolution of the Pages Router based on community feedback.

Create an app/ folder, then add a layout.tsx and page.tsx file. These will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (/).

Create a root layout inside <Highlight>app/layout.tsx</Highlight> with the required <Tag>html</Tag> and <Tag>body</Tag> tags:

```tsx:lib/mdx.ts showLineNumbers
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Run the Development Server

- Run npm run dev to start the development server.
- Visit http://localhost:3000 to view your application.
- Edit app/layout.tsx (or pages/index.tsx) file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.
